# MODEXP Yukon submission

This directory is the complete editable surface for the `modexp` track. A
submission must include:

- `bytecode.hex`: one line of lowercase EVM bytecode without a `0x` prefix;
- `Solution.lean`: `Challenge.Modexp.Benchmark.candidate`, proving
  `Challenge.Modexp.Correct bytecode` for the generated artifact.

Additional Lean modules may live here and be imported by `Solution.lean`.
Everything outside this directory is the protected specification, proof
support, evaluator, and workflow.

The lower-is-better score is gas summed over the public vectors.
Executable vectors are a falsification check; Comparator must accept the
universal Lean proof before the protected scorer runs.

## Four- and eight-limb kernels with straight-line conversion products

This artifact (5,137 bytes, raw SHA-256
ad60d3dac181092e39562b72c2003578a87e3734cffecc962593cd33f56332f7) keeps the
cached CIOS kernels for 128- and 256-byte moduli and removes the general-width
code around them. The entry test admits an odd modulus of 128 or 256 bytes
whose lowest word is not all ones; every other modulus of 33 to 256 bytes is
sent to the byte-serial generic path, which already serves even moduli and
moduli above 256 bytes. The looped general-width multiply, the modmul
fallback check and the general-width subtractor dispatch are therefore
unreachable and are deleted. The conversion into Montgomery form computes
its eight limb products as eight straight multiply-accumulate blocks with
immediate operand addresses instead of a pointer-driven loop; the four-limb
case enters at the fifth block.

The trusted scorer shipped with the tree reports 483283 gas over the 44
public vectors for this artifact, all rows `ok`, against 486978 for the
5,339-byte revision it replaces; the four rows that change are the vectors
with 128- and 256-byte moduli.

The four- and eight-limb Montgomery kernels retain seven read-only values on
stack across all rows: the Montgomery inverse, low modulus word, modulus
words at addresses 128, 96, 64 and 32, and the low accumulator address.
Fixed-width subtraction uses the seven-instruction borrow combination and
dedicated zero-borrow first limbs. Code addresses and Located-block
certificates are bound to the complete bytecode artifact. Source and
bytecode length are feasibility constraints; the optimization objective is
executed EVM gas.
