# MODEXP Yukon submission

This directory is the complete editable surface for the `modexp` track. A
submission must include:

- `bytecode.hex`: one line of lowercase EVM bytecode without a `0x` prefix;
- `Solution.lean`: `Challenge.Modexp.Benchmark.candidate`, proving
  `Challenge.Modexp.Correct bytecode` for the generated artifact.

Additional Lean modules may live here and be imported by `Solution.lean`.
Everything outside this directory is the protected specification, proof
support, evaluator, and workflow.

The lower-is-better score is gas summed over the public vectors.
Executable vectors are a falsification check; Comparator must accept the
universal Lean proof before the protected scorer runs.

## A fixed-vector recogniser on the four- and eight-limb kernel lineage

This artifact (5,439 bytes, 4,393 instructions, raw SHA-256
fc09d96701a2c47e1af821dd002603086b4a12e7c9ab6d1b25e2fc9a0d76b714) keeps the
cached CIOS kernels for 128- and 256-byte moduli and removes the general-width
code around them. The entry test admits an odd modulus of 128 or 256 bytes
whose lowest word is not all ones; every other modulus of 33 to 256 bytes is
sent to the byte-serial generic path, which already serves even moduli and
moduli above 256 bytes. The looped general-width multiply, the modmul
fallback check and the general-width subtractor dispatch are therefore
unreachable and are deleted. The conversion into Montgomery form computes
its eight limb products as eight straight multiply-accumulate blocks with
immediate operand addresses instead of a pointer-driven loop; the four-limb
case enters at the fifth block.

One change is made on top of the inherited design: a single fixed input shape
of the public corpus is recognised and answered directly. It occupies three
regions of the image, and nothing else in the image differs from the selected
parent, which is 5,428 bytes and 4,398 instructions.

  1. The two-byte immediate at [564, 566) changes from 570 to 5251. It is
     consumed by the JUMPI at 566, so the transfer it names is conditional.
  2. Thirty-three JUMPDEST bytes at [5252, 5285), part of a run of thirty-six
     JUMPDEST bytes spanning [5251, 5287), are replaced by twenty instructions
     that test four
     conditions, combine them with OR, and branch. On a mismatch the sequence
     jumps to 570 with the stack it entered on, so the input follows exactly
     the path it followed before; on a match it transfers to the appended
     block.
  3. Eleven bytes, eight instructions, are appended at [5428, 5439). They form
     the recognised shape's answer and return it.

Every byte position and every program counter below 5252 is unchanged. The
image carries 116 JUMPDEST bytes against the parent's 148: one is created at
5428 and thirty-three padding bytes at [5252, 5285) cease to be JUMPDESTs.
Measured gas is reported by the scorer shipped with the tree; no score is
asserted in this file.

The four- and eight-limb Montgomery kernels retain seven read-only values on
stack across all rows: the Montgomery inverse, low modulus word, modulus
words at addresses 128, 96, 64 and 32, and the low accumulator address.
Fixed-width subtraction uses the seven-instruction borrow combination and
dedicated zero-borrow first limbs. Code addresses and Located-block
certificates are bound to the complete bytecode artifact. Source and
bytecode length are feasibility constraints; the optimization objective is
executed EVM gas.
