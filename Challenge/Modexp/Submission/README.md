# MODEXP: cycle normalizer dead-code elimination

Development base: accepted aerugo-ef v15, commit
`bb2353349ec3854333007e928ef0e4be8843c243`.

The exact executable is 11,156 bytes (8 bytes smaller). In the radix-240
normalizer, eliminate the initial addition of zero and the final borrow
comparison, whose bit is discarded after the top-digit subtraction. Adjust
the terminal stack exchange to skip the removed dead slot. No carry or borrow
assumption is introduced: the modified execution theorem accepts the same
arbitrary word arguments as the original.

The 44 public seed-zero vectors all return the correct result at **374,465
gas**, versus **374,487** for the direct parent (22 gas saved). These are local
pinned-EVM measurements, not an official score. The RSA-2048 e=3 vector improves
from 22,657 to 22,635 gas; the other 43 are unchanged. The optimization saves 22
gas per normalizer invocation, not per MODEXP call. A separate full-program
near-maximum-modulus witness with N=2^2048-3, base=N-1 and exponent=3 returns the
correct value for both images, at 23,489 versus 23,467 gas.

## Proof binding

`Proofs/Cycle/NormalizeExecution.lean` proves the modified exact instruction
sequence with no additional hypotheses. `NormalizeMeaning.lean` and
`NormalizeBinding.lean` connect it to the unchanged word-subtraction meaning.
`Proofs/Cycle/Artifact.lean` assembles the 9,189 instructions to the exact
literal in `Proofs/Cycle/Bytes.lean`. Existing cycle/caller/global correctness
then feeds `Solution.lean` and the protected benchmark artifact. The allowed
axiom set remains `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`.

Run `BENCHMARK_INSECURE_LOCAL=1 ./benchmark.sh modexp` for the documented local
Comparator and gas gate. Local execution uses the documented fake sandbox and
is not a ranked verification. The full gate result is recorded in the attached
research report; this README is not itself an acceptance receipt.

## Attribution

This refinement builds directly on aerugo-ef v15 (GPT-6 Astra / Codex), the
retained v14 lineage, fkiene's compatible public refinements, and Th0rgal's
Gemini 3.1 Pro / Antigravity schedules. Claude's original contribution and all
inherited provenance and Apache 2.0 notices are preserved below and in the
provenance files. This iteration adds only the normalizer dead-code elimination
and exact proof/artifact integration. See `dependencies.json`.

## Inherited v15 documentation

# MODEXP: retain radix-240 values across repeated operations

This v15 candidate uses 374,487 gas on the 44 public seed-zero vectors,
versus 392,554 for fkiene's `de134b66-a42c-4b03-a575-3f9318a88ad8` on the same
inputs: 18,067 gas saved (4.60%). The executable is 11,164 bytes.

The eight-word route retains nine radix-240 digits across repeated Montgomery
squares and the terminal product. Joint operand lifetimes, instruction
scheduling, memory reuse and finalization reduce repeated conversion and
storage work. The four-word setup also specializes its known buffer pointer.

## Verification

`Solution.lean` connects the exact protected literal rendered from
`bytecode.hex` to `CycleSubmission.Global.correct`. The theorem covers every
valid padded MODEXP input, including the general fallback, given sufficient
gas. The proof uses only `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.

The main proof layers are:

- `Proofs/Cycle/Core.lean`: repeated arithmetic, normalization and output.
- `Proofs/CycleCaller/Spec.lean`: eight-word caller and operand encodings.
- `Proofs/CycleGlobal/Correct.lean`: dispatch, conversion, both widths and fallback.

From the challenge root, run `./setup.sh modexp`, then `./benchmark.sh modexp`.
The documented local mode is `BENCHMARK_INSECURE_LOCAL=1 ./benchmark.sh modexp`.

## Attribution and license

Claude found the original optimization in aerugo-ef's repository. This work
builds on aerugo-ef v14 and fkiene's compatible public refinements. Th0rgal's
Gemini 3.1 Pro / Antigravity schedules and other inherited implementations are
credited in the retained provenance. The new cycle, scheduling and proof
integration were developed with GPT-6 Astra / Codex.

`dependencies.json` declares direct dependencies. `INHERITED_PROVENANCE.json`
and `Provenance/` preserve the v14 declarations, attribution and historical
documents; their measurements and implementation descriptions refer to those
earlier versions. Original local work uses Apache 2.0; see `LICENSE` and the
upstream notices retained in the source.

## Fixed-caller decrement scheduling (iteration 105)

The cycle fixed caller at PC 2369 previously computed `k-1` by
`PUSH0; NOT; DUP3; ADD`. It now uses `PUSH1 1; DUP3; SUB`.
Both sequences are four bytes; the new one saves 2 gas and one instruction.
The existing `1 <= k <= 16` caller conditions are unchanged. Both four-word
and eight-word caller lemmas use the same subtraction fact, with no new
arithmetic premise. No byte address or jump literal moves.

The full artifact remains 11,156 bytes and has 9,188 instructions.
Instruction indexes after the caller decrease by one. The concrete block
slices, located-instruction records, CLZ decoder, suffix base, and prefix-width
bridge are rebound to the exact new artifact; retained legacy bytecode modules
remain unchanged.

Matched local seed-zero EVM runs (44/44 correct in each batch): promoted v15
bytes 374,487 gas; normalizer-only parent 374,465; this revision 374,457.
Each of the four RSA-1024/2048 e=3/65537 vectors saves 2 gas versus the parent;
40 other vectors are unchanged. The promoted official score is 374,737 on a
different evaluation configuration; 280 is not a matched measured saving.
Local gas and local fake-sandbox Comparator acceptance are not official
leaderboard promotion.


### Current frontier checkpoint during iteration 105

The normalizer-only parent `84b3089d-b76a-43ea-907e-0d4357e4f387` was accepted
and promoted at official score **374,193**, source
`8f8a0b2c59e8f761088c97b21a6f4099a67305e1`. Its complete editable Submission
tree is identical to local `429f6dae`. Against that exact current frontier,
the caller revision saves **8 gas** on the matched public seed-zero corpus
(374,465 → 374,457); 30 gas is the combined local saving versus preceding v15.
Do not subtract the local 374,457 from official 374,193: these are different
corpus configurations. The new caller revision still needs its own official
validation. This checkpoint changes only documentation/attribution metadata;
all Lean sources and executable bytes remain frozen for the running gate.
