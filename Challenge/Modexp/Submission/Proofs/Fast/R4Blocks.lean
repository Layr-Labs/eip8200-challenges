Rider: the five stores consume the top five stack values in stack order instead of `DUP`ing
them.  The slots the `DUP`s vacated are absorbed into the neighbouring `PUSH` by widening it
and left-padding the immediate with zero bytes, so the pcs and the instruction boundaries are
still preserved, and the pushed values are bit-identical — but the padding now costs nothing,
where a `JUMPDEST` cost 1 gas on every execution.  The five target words `0x820 .. 0x8a0` are
pairwise disjoint and word-aligned, so the reordered writes commute
(`writeBytes_comm_disjoint`), and the highest touched word is unchanged, so the
memory-expansion charge is identical.  The eleven incoming values are dead either way: the
block leaves with stack depth 0 and jumps to `0xfa5`.

Ten instructions are deleted, so every instruction index after 3705 shifts down by 10; the
pcs, and hence every jump destination and every pushed code pointer, are untouched. -/
