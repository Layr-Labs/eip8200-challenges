/-! ## Artifact-agnostic readings of a certified slice

`WindowTwentyOneSlice.locations` reads its slice as `artifact.instructions[start + k]` for
each `k`; on a 3,984-instruction list that is `O(start)` work per instruction, and the two
`rfl` obligations of `block` pay it twice (elaborator and kernel).  The two lemmas below are
proved for an ARBITRARY `artifact : ProgramArtifact`, so no concrete bytecode enters them;
the concrete submission is then touched once per obligation, and its instruction prefix is
assembled exactly once, at `pcAnchorBlocks`.  Every `Block` statement is unchanged. -/
